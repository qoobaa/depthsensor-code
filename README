Depthsensor
===========

This repository contains code for a pressure depth sensor, a pump
controller. It's an academic project created by me during studies,
however it should work pretty well in the real life.

Purpose
=======

The main purpose of the project is keeping a constant water level in a
water tank. It might be used for increasing or decreasing the level of
water by driving pumps connected to the device. It uses an analog,
relative air pressure sensor, that detects water level by measuring
air pressure in a plastic hose immersed in the tank.
